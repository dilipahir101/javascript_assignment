    Q.5 What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?

    Ans:
            
        In JavaScript, "undefined" and "undeclared" are related concepts but have different meanings:

        1)Undefined:
        undefined is a primitive data type in JavaScript that represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value, or a variable that does not exist.

        Example:
        let x;
        console.log(x); // Output: undefined
        
        function foo() {
            // This function does not return anything explicitly
        }
        console.log(foo()); // Output: undefined

        

        2)Undeclared:

        An undeclared variable is one that has not been declared using the var, let, or const keywords.

        Example:

        console.log(y); // Output: ReferenceError: y is not defined
