    <!-- Q.10 What is Condition Statement?  -->

    Ans:

    => if statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
    if (condition) {
        // code block to be executed if condition is true
    }

    => if-else statement: Executes one block of code if a specified condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

    if (condition) {
        // code block to be executed if condition is true
    } else {
        // code block to be executed if condition is false
    }

    =>if-else if-else statement: Allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different code blocks based on the evaluation of each condition.

    if (condition1) {
        // code block to be executed if condition1 is true
    } else if (condition2) {
        // code block to be executed if condition2 is true
    } else {
        // code block to be executed if all conditions are false
    }
    
    => switch statement: Provides a way to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of an expression.
    
    switch (expression) {
        case value1:
            // code block to be executed if expression equals value1
            break;
        case value2:
            // code block to be executed if expression equals value2
            break;
        default:
            // code block to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
    }
