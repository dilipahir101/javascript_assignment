    Q.20 What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript? 

    Ans:

    
    => In JavaScript, && and || are logical operators used for performing logical AND and logical OR operations, respectively. Here's the difference between them:

    => && (Logical AND):

    The && operator returns true if both operands are true.
    If the first operand evaluates to false, the second operand is not evaluated because the entire expression will be false regardless of the second operand.
    Example: true && true evaluates to true, true && false evaluates to false.

    => || (Logical OR):
    
    The || operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
    If the first operand evaluates to true, the second operand is not evaluated because the entire expression will be true regardless of the second operand.
    Example: true || false evaluates to true, false || false evaluates to false.
