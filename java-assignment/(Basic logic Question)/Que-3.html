    <!-- Q.3 Define a Data Types in js? -->

    Ans:

    In JavaScript, there are several data types used to represent different kinds of values. Here's an overview of the main data types in JavaScript:

    1) Primitive Data Types:

        =>String: Represents textual data enclosed within single ('') or double ("") quotes.
        let name = "dilip";

        =>Number: Represents numeric data, including integers and floating-point numbers.
        let age = 30;

        =>Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.
        let isStudent = true;

        =>Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value.
        let result = null;

        =>Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.\
        let x;

        =>Symbol (ES6+): Represents a unique identifier, useful for object property keys.
        const id = Symbol("uniqueID");

    

    2)Non-primitive Data Type:

        =>Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be any data type, including other objects.
        let person = {
            name: "John",
            age: 30,
            isStudent: true
        };
        
        =>Array: Represents an ordered collection of elements, typically of the same data type.
        let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

        =>Function: Represents a reusable block of code that can be called to perform a specific task.
        function greet(name) {
            console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
        }
