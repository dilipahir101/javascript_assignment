    <!-- Q.21 What is the use of Void (0)? 

    Ans:

   => In JavaScript, void(0) is an expression that evaluates to undefined. The void operator is used to evaluate an expression and return undefined. It's typically used in situations where you want to perform an action without affecting the current page or causing navigation. -->


      Example: 
                
                <a href="javascript:void(0)">Click me</a>
