    <!-- Q.19 What is the use of is Nan function? 

    Ans:

    => The "isNaN()" function in programming is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not. NaN is a special value that typically represents the result of an invalid mathematical operation, such as dividing zero by zero or trying to parse a non-numeric value as a number.

    => Here's a simple example in JavaScript: -->
    
    <script>
        
        var x = 10 / "abc"; // x will be NaN
    
    if (isNaN(x)) {
        console.log("x is NaN");
    } else {
        console.log("x is a valid number");
    }
    </script>
