<!-- Q.60 Array vs object defences in JS? -->

        // Arrays:

        // An array is an ordered collection of values, where each value is identified by an index.
        // Arrays are typically used to store multiple values of the same type, such as a list of numbers, strings, or objects.
        // The elements of an array can be accessed and manipulated using numeric indices.
        // Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink in size dynamically as elements are added or removed.
        // Common array operations include adding or removing elements, accessing elements by index, iterating over elements, and performing array-specific operations like mapping, filtering, and reducing.
        // Example:


        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

        //         Objects:

        // An object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each value is associated with a unique key.
        // Objects are typically used to represent structured data and are often used to model real-world entities.
        // Keys in an object are strings (or Symbols), and each key is associated with a value.
        // Object properties can be accessed and manipulated using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']).
        // Objects in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning properties can be added, updated, or removed at runtime.
        // Common object operations include accessing properties, adding or updating properties, deleting properties, and iterating over keys or values.
        // Example:

        const person = {
            name: 'John',
            age: 30,
            city: 'New York'
        };
        const car = {
            brand: 'Toyota',
            model: 'Camry',
            year: 2024
        };
    </script>
