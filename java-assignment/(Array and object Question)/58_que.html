<!-- Q.59 What is Bom vs Dom in JS? -->

<body>
    <!--      
    DOM (Document Object Model):

The DOM represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a hierarchical tree structure.
It provides a way for JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page.
Each element in an HTML document is represented as a node in the DOM tree.
JavaScript can access and modify DOM elements using methods and properties provided by the DOM API.
Example DOM operations include selecting elements, changing their attributes or content, and adding or removing elements from the document. -->


    <!-- BOM (Browser Object Model):

The BOM represents the browser itself as an object model, providing access to browser-specific features and functionalities.
It includes objects such as window, document, location, history, navigator, etc.
The window object is the top-level object in the BOM and represents the browser window or tab.
BOM provides functionalities like opening or closing windows, controlling browser history, manipulating the URL, detecting user's browser and operating system, etc.
Unlike the DOM, which deals with the content and structure of web pages, the BOM deals with browser-related features and interactions. -->
